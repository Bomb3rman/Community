{% include common-defs %}
PhoneGap is an Open Source Cross-Platform HTML5 Framework that was developed by Nitobi.
RIM participated in PhoneGap to add support for the BlackBerry Smartphones and the BlackBerry PlayBook,
and to provide alignment with WebWorks.
In LATE/TBD 2011  Nitobi contributed the framework to Apache and was acquired by Adobe.
Adobe continues to contribute to the technology, currently in the incubator under the name
[Apache Cordova](Apache_Cordova.html) and provides tools and other services around it.

See [Apache Cordova](Apache_Cordova.html).
And see [Apache Cordova][foo]. And see [this is a one][1].
