#Latest Community News

This page collects news from the community.  Reporters from the community submit news using the
Edit-in-place feature of GitHub;
if you don't have push rights on this repository, a community editor will review and
accept your contribution.

Use the example from the bottom of the page, and adjust the fields as appropriate.
Place your submission at the top of the page so the latest news show first.
Note this is a [markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) page.

Community editors will regularly review this page, create new posts accessible from the
[Main News Page](index.html) and will reset the page for the next batch.
